I have a CSV file about movies. It has about 10k rows. It's saved in the sandbox at {dataset_path_in_sandbox.path}.
These are the columns:
- 'id': number, id of the movie
- 'original_language': string like "eng", "es", "ko", etc
- 'original_title': string that's name of the movie in the original language
- 'overview': string about the movie
- 'popularity': float, from 0 to 9137.939. It's not normalized at all and there are outliers
- 'release_date': date in the format yyyy-mm-dd
- 'title': string that's the name of the movie in english
- 'vote_average': float number between 0 and 10 that's representing viewers voting average
- 'vote_count': int for how many viewers voted

I want to better understand how the vote average has changed over the years.
Write Python code that analyzes the dataset based on my request and produces right chart accordingly"""
